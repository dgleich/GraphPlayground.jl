# GraphPlayground

There are two main components to [GraphPlayground](https://github.com/dgleich/GraphPlayground.jl).

- A "easy-to-use" way to play around with a `Graphs.jl` graph 
  with an interactive window. 
- An underlying [`ForceSimulation`](@ref) that handles the dynamics. 

See the pages in the sidebar for more information.
